Tomorrow, 

 - Rebuild the structure:
	- Old structure
		- Cirle and Plot share "arr", but are separate. arr is static.
		- But I need circle things to affect plot things. So, they have to be combined
	- New structure
		- I should start over with a new Engine
			- Engine is composed in Main
			- Engine inherits Arr:
				- Arr is the data structure, rebuilt around pygame
				- It's static
				- It provides var's, lookups and conversion functions
			- Engine has a draw module:
				- Draw plot -- axes and array
				- Draw circle
				- Draw instructions
			- Engine has a K I/O module:
				- Or, maybe this is a module of Main?? 
				- I'm imagining... press left/right to scale k by 1, or hold up/down to go faster
			- Engine itself does the stuff below

Engine:
	- Moves the circle -- takes moving flag from Main, and mx/my

	- Tracks "K" and the middle of the circle

	- Performs the KNN calculation
		- Calculates euclidian distance to all coordinates
		- Identifies the K nearest ones
			- Flags those -- maybe to colour them
			- Identifies which category they are from (Survived or not Survived)
				- Thus, the circle midpoint can be categorized
			- Sets the circle radius based on the furthest "nearest neighbour)

	- Calls the different functions in Draw(), and passes parameters


Arr
	- It would also be nice to be able to view the play in the original array units
		- i.e., what was the actual fare and age for those people
	- So, I would need some more complex conversion functions in arr.py
